# Deploy Laravel Applications to /var/www folder
Use this fast Shell Script for deploying your Laravel Applications with Apache in Linux, saving all to /var/www folder. You just need to configure git, and run this script in a normal user folder. 

You just need to update the script with your user and group, and run it when you need to deploy a new commit :)
